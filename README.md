# Inventory-Management-System-using-JSON
An Inventory Management System using JSON is a software solution that tracks and manages product stock, purchases, and sales by storing all inventory data in JSON files. This method leverages JSONâ€™s human-readable, key-value format to record product details like name, price, quantity, and category, making it easy to update, retrieve, and manage inventory using file-based storage. Functions typically include adding or removing products, updating stock levels, and generating inventory reports, all while reading from and writing to JSON files using programming languages such as Python.
